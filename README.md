The code starts in the Main class is where it parses arguments and calls the appropriate
Critter method to get output. Params contained all the parameters in the world and the
different implementations of Critters formed the rest of the Classes. Each of these Critters
implement different methods and have their own different fields based on their behaviors.
All currently alive and simulated Critters were stored in a static ArrayList in the Critter
class. This is because the Critter class is abstract and cannot be instantiated.
